## Things I'm Confused About
I think I understand the basic ideas behind git/github, but getting used to the interface may take some time.
I've attempted to use GitHub for a couple of class projects, but we ended up scrapping it due to having 
difficulty navigating it. I'm glad that this class will being using github regularly so I will be able to learn
how to use it, as it is necessary for most jobs in this field.
